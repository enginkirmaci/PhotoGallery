# Photo Gallery

The Photo Gallery is a lightweight and user-friendly application developed using WPF. It has been specifically designed to provide a convenient solution for managing and viewing AI-generated images while the generation process continues. As the generation process runs in the background, this application allows you to monitor a specified folder, providing a real-time gallery view of the images being produced. The Photo Gallery offers an effortless way to organize and explore your AI-generated image collection.
